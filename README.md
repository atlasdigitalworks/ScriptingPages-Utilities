## General Info
'ScriptingPages Command-Line Utilities' is a collection of Utilities written in C# for Windows Operating Systems written by RobvanderWoude. I have simply compiled the code into useable executable format and packaged them together neatly for ease of use. I have made zero changes to the original code, and have only run them through the Roslyn C# Compiler, 'csc.exe', included with Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
Below you'll find a list of all the utilities included, with a link to RobvanderWoude's site and the page containing relevant info on each utilitie's use and any dependencies.
Please be sure to checkout the original authors site at: https://www.robvanderwoude.com/
